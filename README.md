### Random Monster Generator
## Create new (and perhaps ridiculous) monsters for D&D 3.5!
This program randomly generates monsters for use in your D&D 3.5 campaigns. The following attributes are generated for each monster:
+ A name, which may include a descriptor (e.g. Giant, Ancient, or Shambling), a prefix (e.g. Krako- or Octo-), and a root name (e.g. Donkey, Puppy, or Dragon)
+ Size and type
+ Hit dice and average hit points
+ Movement and speed
+ Attacks and damage
+ Special qualities
+ Alignment
